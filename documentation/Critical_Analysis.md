#Critical Analysis

This document lists some of the limitations we faced while undertaking this project. While the key aspects of the project were completed successfully, it was not without its difficulties. One of the main difficulties we faced was our workforce itself. The original team consisted of 5 members. However, two members dropped out subsequently without ANY input whatsoever. 

One of the requirements of the project was access to a Mac/UNIX system. We initially fulfilled this requirement as a member of our team had a Mac. Also our design methodology was based on equal work from all members of team so we allocated 2 members to the applet, 1 member to the server and 2 members to the communication gateway (i.e. Kannel). However as both these members dropped out (and one of these members had the Mac) we suffered a substantial setback. Despite this, we had a meeting with our client, and we were generously helped by Simulity to use some pre-set configurations which helped us from stretching ourselves, making up for the lost team members.

Another factor to be taken into consideration is that all of the software / hardware we used belonged to Simulity, so due to security considerations and so as not to cause any harm to their business, we were restricted (and rightfully so) in our access to the server. Originally, the plan was to implement our own server but as previously mentioned, because of the mitigating circumstances regarding the workforce, Simulity allowed us to use their server, which we could deploy our web service to with little modifications. We were also given a proprietary software owned by Simulity which they use to format the Sim cards to industry specifications. Again due to licencing reasons, we are unable to reproduce it here.
