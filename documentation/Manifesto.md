OmÃ¡da Programming has been based on the agile development methodology.
The manifesto for this has been shown below:

>- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We are trying to/have implemented this in various ways including:

- Programming on the client's premises to maximise efficiency. Co-location has been an important part of our approach as the team has made multiple visits to the client and had much face-to-face contact.
- Pair programming: myself (Delvin Varghese) and Dom Lee have been working on the applet side of the project and have met up initially to program together.
- Each week we have been implementing new code to present to the client a tangible way of seeing work progress.
- We have been very involved with the client in terms of the project and made sure our team's vision of the completed software is in line with their needs.
- Sustainable development has also been achieved in our view as we have been developing at a constant pace.
- The team has also been self-organising as we have divided the task into 3 manageable chunks to be divided among the four members:
 - The Applet is mine and Dom Lee's responsibility.
 - The Server is being developed by Brasoveanu Andrei Alexandru
 - The Gateway/Kannel implementation has been accepted by Konstantinos Akrivos.
- However, it is to be noted that we have set out with the aim of responding to change as we have agreed upon helping other members of the team should they require assistance on any difficulty.
