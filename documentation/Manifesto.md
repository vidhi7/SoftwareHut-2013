# Our Manifesto #
*by Delvin Varghese*
####JavaCard Development Simulity


*Team Members: Brasoveanu Andrei Alexandru, Dominic Lee, Delvin Varghese*

OmÃ¡da Programming has been based on the agile development methodology.
The manifesto for this has been shown below:

>- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan


This was implemented in various ways including:

- Programming on the client's premises to maximise efficiency. Co-location has been an important part of Omada programming's approach as the team has made multiple visits to the client and had much face-to-face contact.
- Pair programming: Delvin Varghese and Dom Lee have been working on the applet side of the project and have met up initially to program together.
- Each week implementation of new code has taken place to present to the client a tangible way of seeing work progress.
- The team has been very involved with the client in terms of the project and made sure the team's vision of the completed software is in line with the client's needs.
- Sustainable development has also been achieved in our view as the team has been developing at a constant pace.
- The team has also been self-organising and divided the task into 3 manageable chunks to be divided among the four members:
- The Applet required knowledge in Javacard (Java bytecode) and various SIM industry specifications provided as part of the development kit, including: 
>3GPP TS 51.011<br>
3GPP TS 03.48<br>
3GPP TS 11.14<br>
3GPP TS 23.038
- The Server is being developed using JSP,nodeJS,EDS and RDS technologies. 
- The Gateway/Kannel implementation has been done according to standards presented in the official documentation .
- However, it is to be noted that the team has set out with the aim of responding to change as we have agreed upon helping other members of the team should they require assistance on any difficulty.
