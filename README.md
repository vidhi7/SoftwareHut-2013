SoftwareHut-2013
================

This project was completed by the 2013 SoftwareHut team at Bangor University. The students successfully created a JavaCard 2.2.1 Application which sent a message to a Java server which in turn requested a 'Fortune' message and sends the message using 03.48 OTA to the handset, which displays the message.
